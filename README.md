I stayed a long time in this, and it is very simple, but the verification to know if it is a binary number I need to take a look and correct, the way I did it returns a NaN and does not respond the way I want. 😩

I checked the code in the app-ideas suggestions, and I need to dig deeper into the javascript

### Update 🌠
I finally did it, i researched about arrow functions, split() and map(), and when I knew how it worked, it was magical 🎆, i understood how the code and logic worked. The only problem is break the map() whether the 'if' is true, i researched each(), but i still don't understand how it works 
So, what i learned:
- Basic Arrow Functions
- .map()
- .aplit()
- Positional notation
- Binary numeral system
