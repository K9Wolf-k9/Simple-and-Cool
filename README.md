# Simple-and-Cool
 Simple programs based on [app-ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas) from florinpop17
 
This repository will represent my progress in javaScript and programming as a whole, and also practice english
## Bin2Dec ✊☝

I stayed a long time in this, and it is very simple, but the verification to know if it is a binary number I need to take a look and correct, the way I did it returns a NaN and does not respond the way I want. 😩

I checked the code in the app-ideas suggestions, and I need to dig deeper into the javascript

### Update 🌠
I finally did it, i researched about arrow functions, split() and map(), and when I knew how it worked, it was magical 🎆, i understood how the code and logic worked. The only problem is break the map() whether the 'if' is true, i researched each(), but i still don't understand how it works.

So, what i learned:
- Basic Arrow Functions
- .map()
- .aplit()
- Positional notation
- Binary numeral system

## Border-radius Previewer ⬜

This is giving work, make the site easier for the user to click on the border change areas, and copy the properties, these two i need to study more, in addition to optimizing the code.
I'll take a break from this project to think, study more JavaScript, and do other exercises so i don't get stuck in this. 🤔

### Update 🌠
I couldn't wait another day and i didn't wait, this program was bothering my head, so i finnaly did it. I learned a lot of thing in this exercise, i research a lot and i couldn't sleep without copleting it

So, what i learned:
- CSS: Box Model
- CSS: pseudo-class
- Copy to Clipboard

Now yes, i'll take a break from this project to study HTML,CSS,JavaScript, and study to further optimize the code.😌
